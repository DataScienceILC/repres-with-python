# Python Environments

Let's walk through the process of creating a Python virtual environment using Conda, starting with the installation of Miniconda.

### 1. Why Use Python Environments?

- **Isolation**: Virtual environments allow you to work on multiple projects with different dependencies without conflicts. Each environment can have its own set of installed packages, ensuring that projects don't interfere with each other.
  
- **Version Control**: Different projects might require different versions of packages or even Python itself. Virtual environments allow you to specify and maintain these versions separately for each project.
  
- **Clean Environment**: If a project gets too messy or you run into unresolvable issues, you can simply delete its virtual environment and create a new one without affecting your system or other projects.

### 2. What is Conda?

Conda is an open-source package management system and environment management system. While `pip` and `virtualenv` are popular tools for managing Python packages and environments, Conda serves a similar purpose but with some differences:

- Conda can create environments for any language, not just Python.
  
- Conda environments can include non-Python binaries (like C libraries), making it more versatile for certain projects.
  
- Conda has its own set of packages, but it can also use `pip` if needed.

### 3. Installing Miniconda:

Miniconda is a minimal installer for Conda. It's lightweight and only contains Conda and its dependencies, unlike Anaconda which comes with a lot of pre-installed packages.

**For Linux**:
```bash
wget https://repo.anaconda.com/miniconda/Miniconda3-latest-Linux-x86_64.sh
bash Miniconda3-latest-Linux-x86_64.sh
```

**For macOS**:
```bash
wget https://repo.anaconda.com/miniconda/Miniconda3-latest-MacOSX-x86_64.sh
bash Miniconda3-latest-MacOSX-x86_64.sh
```

**For Windows**:
Download the installer from [Miniconda's website](https://docs.conda.io/en/latest/miniconda.html) and execute it.

Follow the prompts in the installer. It's recommended to allow Miniconda to prepend its path to your PATH variable.

### 4. Creating a Conda Environment:

To create a new environment:
```bash
conda create --name myenv python=3.8
```
Replace `myenv` with your desired environment name and `3.8` with your desired Python version.

### 5. Activating the Environment:

Before using the environment, you need to activate it:
```bash
conda activate myenv
```

### 6. Installing Packages:

Once the environment is activated, you can install packages using:
```bash
conda install numpy
```
Or, if a package is not available in the Conda repositories:
```bash
pip install somepackage
```

### 7. Deactivating the Environment:

To deactivate the current environment and return to the base or system environment:
```bash
conda deactivate
```

### 8. Listing Environments:

To see a list of all your environments:
```bash
conda env list
```

### 9. Removing an Environment:

If you no longer need an environment, you can remove it:
```bash
conda env remove --name myenv
```

### Conclusion:

Using Conda (or any environment manager) is crucial for maintaining clean, isolated, and reproducible development environments. It ensures that your projects remain portable and that dependencies don't clash between projects.

## VENV

To create and activate a local Python environment using `venv`, follow these steps:

### 1. Creating a Virtual Environment:

First, navigate to the directory where you want to create the virtual environment. Then, use the `venv` module to create the environment. Replace `myenv` with your desired environment name:

```bash
python -m venv myenv
```

This will create a directory named `myenv` (or whatever name you choose) in the current directory. This directory will contain the Python interpreter, the standard library, and various supporting files.

### 2. Activating the Virtual Environment:

Once the environment is created, you need to activate it. The activation command differs based on your operating system:

- **Linux or macOS**:

  ```bash
  source myenv/bin/activate
  ```

- **Windows** (Command Prompt):

  ```bash
  .\myenv\Scripts\activate
  ```

- **Windows** (PowerShell):

  ```bash
  .\myenv\Scripts\Activate.ps1
  ```

When the environment is activated, your shell prompt will change to show the name of the activated environment. Any Python packages you install while the environment is activated will be installed in this environment, isolated from the global Python environment.

### 3. Deactivating the Virtual Environment:

To deactivate the virtual environment and return to the global Python environment, simply run:

```bash
deactivate
```

### Note:

Ensure you have the `venv` module installed. It comes pre-installed with Python versions 3.3 and later. If you're using a version of Python prior to 3.3, you might need to install `virtualenv` which offers similar functionality.
