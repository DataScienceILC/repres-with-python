Building a Python package involves several steps. Here's a step-by-step guide to help you build a Python package from a collection of self-defined functions and a dataset:

1. **Directory Structure**:
   Create a directory structure for your package. For example, if your package name is `mypackage`:
   ```
   mypackage/
   ├── mypackage/
   │   ├── __init__.py
   │   ├── functions.py
   │   ├── dataset/
   │   │   ├── data.csv
   │   ├── ...
   ├── setup.py
   ├── README.md
   ├── LICENSE
   ```

2. **Write Your Functions**:
   In the `functions.py` file (or any other module name you prefer), write your self-defined functions.

3. **Include Dataset**:
   Place your dataset (e.g., `data.csv`) inside the `dataset` directory or any other directory you prefer within the package.

4. **`__init__.py` File**:
   This file makes Python treat the directory as containing packages. It can be empty or can contain valid Python code. If you want to make certain functions or variables available when the package is imported, you can define them in this file.

5. **`setup.py` File**:
   This is the build script for `setuptools`. It provides metadata about your package (like its name and version) and lists its dependencies. Here's a basic example:
   ```python
   from setuptools import setup, find_packages

   setup(
       name='mypackage',
       version='0.1',
       packages=find_packages(),
       install_requires=[
           # List your package's dependencies here
       ],
       include_package_data=True,  # This will include non-python files like your dataset
       package_data={
           'mypackage': ['dataset/*'],
       },
   )
   ```

6. **README and LICENSE**:
   - `README.md`: Describe your package, how to install it, and how to use it.
   - `LICENSE`: Include a license for your package.

7. **Building the Package**:
   Navigate to the root directory (`mypackage/`) and run:
   ```
   python setup.py sdist
   ```
   This will create a source distribution of your package in a `dist` directory.

8. **Installing Locally**:
   You can install the package locally using:
   ```
   pip install .
   ```

9. **Publishing to PyPI**:
   If you want to share your package with others, you can publish it to the Python Package Index (PyPI). First, you'll need to create an account on [PyPI](https://pypi.org/). Then, install `twine`:
   ```
   pip install twine
   ```
   Use `twine` to upload your package:
   ```
   twine upload dist/*
   ```

10. **Installing from PyPI**:
    Once your package is on PyPI, anyone can install it using:
    ```
    pip install mypackage
    ```

Remember to keep your package updated with new versions as you make changes or enhancements. Always update the version number in `setup.py` when you make changes and want to release a new version.
